# Unity-Obj-Material-Assigner
A WIP .obj file material/texture assigner because I got annoyed at them never being auto assigned


## How To Use
<ul>
  <li>Import the package into your project</li>
  <li>Open the editorwindow by clicking under the Importer tab on the top bar</li>
  <li>Orient the layout of your OBJ/textures/material folder in the way that is in the image below</li>
  <li>Drag the .obj to the slot in the editorwindow</li>
  <li>Click Load</li>
  <li>Once that is complete, click on the obj in the project folder, go to materials in the inspector, and set it up in the format that is in the second image below</li>
  <li>That should be it, if you have bugs or issues,  let me know</li>
</ul>
